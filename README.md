tidyverse tips
==============

This is a blog for various `tidyverse` tips from around the web. I try to update
this blog everyday, but that's not always possible. 


## Blog structure and theme  

This blog was build using the `blogdown` package. The
[Hugo Terminal](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal/) theme was written
by Radek Kozie. More information on this is below: 

The theme includes:

- **5 duotone themes**, depending on your preferences (orange, red, blue, green, pink)
- [**Fira Code**](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) as default monospaced font. It's gorgeous!
- **realy nice, custom duotone** syntax highlighting based on [**PrismJS**](https://prismjs.com)
- mobile friendly layout

### Set up 

The initial setup was configured with Github using the following commands in 
the Terminal:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/mjfrigaard/tidyverse-tips.git
git push -u origin master
```
