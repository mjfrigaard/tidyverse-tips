# Tidyverse.tips blog setup

This document covers the initial setup for the https://www.tidyverse.tips/ website. It was built using [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and [Hugo academic](https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/).

## Building new site

```r
blogdown::new_site(theme = "wowchemy/starter-academic")
```

This produces the following output (with two `WARN`ings)

```r

After pushing to Github, the site is live (but with demo only).
