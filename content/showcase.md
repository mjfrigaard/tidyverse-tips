## `shiny` app for checking blood glucose monitors

> The error grids clinicians use to check the accuracy of blood glucose monitors are out-of-date. Regulatory agencies donâ€™t use error grids for approving monitors, but these tools could be useful for testing the performance of recommended products. The Diabetes Technology Society partnered with representatives from the Food and Drug Administration, the American Diabetes Association, the Endocrine Society, and the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation, and representatives from academia, industry, and government developed the surveillance error grid (SEG) as a tool to assess the degree of clinical risk from inaccurate blood glucose monitors (BGM). I built a Shiny app for clinicians to import data from a BGM, perform statistical tests for accuracy, and create data visualizations to communicate the results
