# Hi there

My name is Martin and I'm a data scientist, R programmer, and author. I created
this site to store various 
[`tidyverse` packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/), blog posts, books,
and other tricks.

The packages in the `tidyverse` can loaded into R using: 

```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```
