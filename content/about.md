# Hi there

My name is Martin. I'm a data scientist, R programmer, and author. I created 
this site to catalog the various 
[packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/), blog posts, books, and other
tricks in the `tidyverse`, along with any peripheral packages that
work well with tidy tools. 

The [`tidyverse`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidyverse) is a collection of 
packages collection of open source R packages introduced by 
[Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/) and the RStudio team that "share an 
underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures" of 
[tidy data](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf).

Read more in the [tidy tools manifesto](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyverse/vignettes/manifesto.html).

## Install the `tidyverse`

The packages in the `tidyverse` can loaded into R using: 

```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

## Learn more 

The best place to learn about the `tidyverse` is in 
[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), or the resources on the 
[RStudio website](https://resources.rstudio.com/).

## Get certified 

If you love using the `tidyverse` and want to teach it to others, consider 
[becoming a certified instructor](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers#info) 
through RStudio's `tidyverse` train-the-trainer course.

See you next time!
