# What is the `tidyverse`?

The [`tidyverse`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidyverse) is a collection of open source R packages introduced by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/) and the RStudio team that "*share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures*." That philosophy is outlined in the [tidy data](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) paper and the [tidy tools manifesto](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyverse/vignettes/manifesto.html).

## Installing the `tidyverse`

The packages in the `tidyverse` can be loaded into [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) or [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) by typing the following commands into the console: 

```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

## Where can I learn more?

The best place to learn about the `tidyverse` is in [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), or the resources on the  [RStudio website](https://resources.rstudio.com/).

## Want to teach the `tidyverse` to others?

If you love using all the tools in the `tidyverse`, and want to teach it to others, consider [becoming a certified instructor](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers#info) 
through RStudio's `tidyverse` train-the-trainer course.

## Who am I?

My name is Martin Frigaard. I'm a data scientist and writer. I've been using R since 2009, and started using tidy tools back when it was still the "Hadley-verse". I write longer-form tutorials for [Storybench's Data Journalism with R](http://www.storybench.org/category/data-journalism-in-r/). I created this site specifically to catalog the growing list of `tidyverse` [packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/), blog posts, books, tweets, and tips.
