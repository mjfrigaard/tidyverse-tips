## Markdown

[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files (`.md`) are common type of plain text files. Markdown is a 'lightweight markup language,' which means it's easy for humans to read, and computers can convert it to HyperText Markup Language (HTML). Markdown allows for some formatting options to aid with communication (see below)

```md
<!-- comments -->

normal text

*italic*

**bold**

> quote

`code`

# h1
## h2
### h3
#### h4
##### h5
###### h6
```

To learn more, see [Markdown Syntax Documentation](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) on John Gruber's site. 

## Why learn markdown?

I recommend learning markdown before any other programming language because it's the lingua franca for asking code related questions on the internet. See [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [RStudio community](https://community.rstudio.com/), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/), [Github](http://github.com/), and many other guidelines for posting questions.

## Rmarkdown

RStudio has an extension of markdown, [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). Using RMarkdown in RStudio allows for a genuinely reproducible workflow: we're able to write our thoughts, code, display results, and then share everything in multiple outputs.

How does it work? Follow the steps below and `copy + paste` the code into your Rmarkdown document. Then click on the Knit icon.

# R Markdown

Load the `tidyverse`.

```{r tidyverse_logo, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
tidyverse::tidyverse_logo()
```


### Code

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes text content, code inputs, and various outputs.

```{r , eval=FALSE}
ggplot2::diamonds %>% dplyr::glimpse(78)
```

### Graphs

You can also include graphs.

```{r , eval=FALSE}
diamonds %>% 
  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) + 
  ggplot2::geom_point()
```
~~~
