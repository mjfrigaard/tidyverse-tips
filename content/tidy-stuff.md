## Storybench's ["Data Journalism with R"](http://www.storybench.org/category/data-journalism-in-r/)

This is a project from Northeastern University's School of Journalism. It was started by [Aleszu Bajak](https://twitter.com/aleszubajak) in 2016 and features common tasks for data journalist's in R and the `tidyverse`. 

## R for Data Science group

Jesse Mostipak started the [R for Data Science learning community](https://www.jessemaegan.com/post/join-the-r-for-data-science-online-learning-community/), and it has a fantastic [Slack channel](rfordatascience.slack.com). Learning is easier when you can do it with others, and the R4DS community is a great place for people looking to get started with Data Science. 

## RStudio Community

[RStudio community](https://community.rstudio.com/) is like a friendlier Stack Overflow for R users. The questions & issues are sorted by topic, and you can get answers by some really smart people. 


## The `#tidytuesday` group

[#tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) is a project launched by [Thomas Mock](https://twitter.com/thomas_mock) and is also part of the R for Data Science Community. Every week a new dataset is uploaded into the Github repo for participants to test their data science skills. Check out [David Robinson's videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeiiqmVK07qhY-wvg3IZiZQ) for examples and inspiration.

## RStudio's education resources

The materials and resources for learning R, RStudio, and other data science topics are amazing. I've linked to the various content in the list below:

+ RStudio's [learning R resources](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/) 

+ RStudio's [teaching materials](https://education.rstudio.com/teach/materials/)

+ The blog post titled, [Remastering ‘Master the Tidyverse’](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2019/09/remaster-tidyverse/) by Garrett Grolemund is a great place to start if you're conisdering teaching the `tidyverse`.
